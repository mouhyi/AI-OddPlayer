MTD can be called with infinity as a first guess (MT-SSS), or it can be run as
MTD-f with a guess based on a previous search. For this, the static move evaluation can be used,
or it can be driven as part of an iterative deepening algorithm that keeps track of the guesses from
search to search. Iterative deepening is discussed more fully in Section 8.6.
